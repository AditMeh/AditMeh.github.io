Hi, my name's Aditya and I'm a fourth year student at UofT studying computer science.

<br>
- Currently I'm doing research under Professor Rahul Gopalkrishnan working on vision transformers for gigapixel images.
- Interning at [Artera AI](https://artera.ai/) as a Machine Learning Intern. Also working with Gigapixel Images.
- Working with Ashkan Mirazei on personalizing diffusion models.

My current interests are in:

- NeRFs
- Generative Models
- Transformers
- Getting things to work properly at larger scales (compute, # data, dimensionality)
- Eventually I plan on learning CUDA + How GPUs are used in deep learning at a low level

Here's my <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KXI2hNXdKIuAaxyukKirS6X_rVlInrvP/view?usp=sharing"> CV </a>.
