Hi, my name's Aditya and I'm a third year student at UofT studying computer science.

<br>
 Currently I'm doing research under professor Rahul Gopalkrishnan working on style transfer for diffusion models while working on some side projects 

 My current interests are in:
- NeRFs
- Generative Models
- Transformers
- Eventually I plan on learning CUDA + How GPUs are used in deep learning at a low level

Here's my <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KXI2hNXdKIuAaxyukKirS6X_rVlInrvP/view?usp=sharing"> CV </a>
